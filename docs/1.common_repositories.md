- Repos under `github.com/kubernetes` should be imported as `k8s.io/<repo>`.

- Kubernetes programming interface `k8s.io/client-go` - is a web service client library that supports all API types that are official part of kubernetes.
  - Can be used to execute the usual REST verbs:
    - Create
    - Get
    - List
    - Update
    - Delete
    - Patch
 
- For each Kubernetes 1.x.y release, there is a client-go release with a matching tag kubernetes-1.x.y.

- Most of the code that speaks to kubernetes APIs use client-go's `tools/clientcmd` to set up a client from a `kubeconfig` file and `kubernetes/` for the actual Kubernetes API clients.

- Kubernetes API types - are located in repo `k8s.io/api`

- API Machinery(k8s.io/apimachinery) - It includes all the generic building blocks to implement a Kubernetes-like API.
  - `k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1` - contains many of the generic API types such as `ObjectMeta, TypeMeta, GetOptions, ListOptions` etc.
